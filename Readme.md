# Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Bot - Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the differences in bidding behavior between humans and bots on Facebook. The project is divided into two main tasks: data analysis and exploratory data analysis with visualization.

## Data

The data files `train.csv.zip` and `bids.csv.zip` can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot/data).

## Problem Definition

Facebook is interested in understanding the difference between the bidding behavior of humans and bots.

## Task 1: Analysis

### Objectives

Using the Python library pandas, calculate the following:

1. For each auction, the number of unique IP addresses.
2. For each merchandise type, the country which sent the maximum number of bids (include also the number of bids sent by that country in the CSV).
3. The data contains three separate time periods. Calculate the average number of unique bidders per auction in each of the three separate time periods.
4. For each country, the fraction of times a bid from that country was identified as coming from a bot.

### Outputs

- 4 CSV files (one per question, called `question_1.csv`, `question_2.csv`, etc.).
- Code used to produce the output (`.ipynb`).

## Task 2: Analysis and Visualization

### Objectives

Using any programming language and libraries of your choice, perform exploratory data analysis on the data. You choose the variables you want to look at, the new features you want to construct, etc.

### Outputs

- A series of graphics with short explanatory texts about the interesting conclusions drawn from each graphic.
- Code used to produce the graphics (e.g., in an `.ipynb` notebook).
